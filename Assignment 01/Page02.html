<p>5. 6 Train: Relaibility: 4/10. Extremely crowded. However it saves a lot of walking for me to the college. Only reason why it's in this list.</p>

<p>4. N Train: N train is pretty reliable as it has both local and express service. It connects Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn. This train can be extremely crowded sometimes. </p>

<p>3. E Train: E tarin is reliable and waiting time is not bad. It connects Queens with Manhattan. However it can be really crowded and dirty during rush hour. It's usually express and saves a lot of time.  Overall it is good.</p>

<p>2. F Train: F train is very reliable as it has a very frequent service. It connects Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn and you can go anywhere with F train. It connects important stations and places in the city which makes it very reliable but it make it crowded too. It can be a little dirty. Howevere, it's my top#2 because of it's express service, less waiting time and connectivity. </p>

<p>1. 7 Train: 7 train is reliable and punctual. It connects Queens with Manhattan.Like F train, 7 trains has stops in big stations which makes it easier to transfer other trains. It can be crowded sometimes, but it is less dirty than most other trains. </p>
